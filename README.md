### <samp>Assignment Description:</samp>

> Choose characters from a comic, movie or TV series. 

> Use the Marvel class build; replace the existing logo with one that matches your selection. 
 
> Update the colours throughout (the header background colour, the red bumper bars, text colour etc)

> Choose a different theme for the page - different background images, etc. Make it your own.

> You can use the same classes and IDs as the class build, but change the colour values etc - *explore what’s possible with CSS.*

### <samp>Assignment Requirements:</samp>

> Update the Marvel Characters Photoshop sprite sheet, re-export it and use it on the page for your main character images.

> Update 2 of the lightboxes to show more content on click; **the background image in each of those lightboxes should be different.** You might need to change the layout of the text and images in the lightbox - *explore how to do this with margins, padding, floats etc.*

> The text content in the lightbox can remain placeholder-only (lorem ipsum).

> Create a well-written readme file and branches as necessary, following workflow as demonstrated in class. Use pull requests and merge as you go.
