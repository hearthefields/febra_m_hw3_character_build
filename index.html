                Joshua "Josh" Washington â€” The Fool
            </h3>
            <p class="lb_text">
                Joshua "Josh" Washington is one of the eight main protagonists and a playable character in Until Dawn. He is the older brother of Hannah and Beth Washington.            </p>
            <p class="lb_text">
                After the disappearance of his twin sisters, he invites his friends back to his family lodge a year later in an attempt to forget the tragedy. He is portrayed by Academy Award-winning actor Rami Malek.
            </p>

                </h3>
                <p class="lb_text">
                    Josh is described as thoughtful, loving, and complex. Josh's interactions with the other survivors tend to be humorous. He cares for his friends, acts as a brotherly figure to Chris, and likes to make sure everyone is having a good time. He goes to Sam for support after the loss of his sisters.</p>
                    
                    <p class="lb_text">
                        His dreams of following his father's footsteps in becoming a film producer make him very knowledgeable about special effects and movie props and as such, he constantly uses phrases and words from movies.</p>
                        
                        <p class="lb_text">
                            Josh struggles to come to terms with the disappearance of his sisters. The event triggered depression, which became more and more severe a year before the events of Until Dawn. He appears to have psychosis, which was caused by this depression, and schizophrenia: a mental illness characterized by a disconnection from reality.</p>
                            
                            <p class="lb_text">
                                If the Psychiatric Report is found, it's revealed that Josh has been diagnosed as mentally ill since he was 11 years old. However, all medications that are listed in the record are solely for depression treatment. It is also implied he has a fear of isolation. During Dr. Hill's therapy sessions, the player can choose Josh's anxieties and insecurities. </p>

                Thor Odinson - The Asgardian
            </h3>
            <p class="lb_text">
                So long, in fact, as you remain in ignorance of what to aim at and what to avoid, what is essential and what is superfluous, what is upright or honorable conduct and what is not, it will not be travelling but drifting. All this hurrying from place to place won't bring you any relief, for you're travelling in the company of your own emotions, followed by your troubles all the way. If only they were really following you! They'd be farther away from you: as it is they're not at your back, but on it! That's why they weigh you down with just the same uncomfortable chafing wherever you are. It's medicine, not a particular part of the world, that a person needs if he's ill.

            </p>
            <p class="lb_text">
                Suppose someone has broken his leg or dislocated a joint; he doesn't get into a carriage or board a ship: he calls in a doctor to have the fracture set or the dislocation reduced. Well then, when a person's spirit is wrenched or broken at so many points, do you imagine that it can be put right by a change of scenery, that that sort of trouble isn't so serious that it can't be cured by an outing?
