        <h3 class="lb_heading"> Joshua "Josh" Washington — The Fool </h3>
        <p class="lb_text"> Joshua "Josh" Washington is one of the eight main protagonists and a playable character in Until Dawn. He is the older brother of Hannah and Beth Washington. </p>
        <p class="lb_text"> After the disappearance of his twin sisters, he invites his friends back to his family lodge a year later in an attempt to forget the tragedy. He is portrayed by Academy Award-winning actor Rami Malek. </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3 class="lb_heading">Personality </h3>
        <p class="lb_text"> Josh is described as thoughtful, loving, and complex. Josh's interactions with the other survivors tend to be humorous. He cares for his friends, acts as a brotherly figure to Chris, and likes to make sure everyone is having a good time. He goes to Sam for support after the loss of his sisters.</p>
        <p class="lb_text"> His dreams of following his father's footsteps in becoming a film producer make him very knowledgeable about special effects and movie props and as such, he constantly uses phrases and words from movies.</p>
        <p class="lb_text"> Josh struggles to come to terms with the disappearance of his sisters. The event triggered depression, which became more and more severe a year before the events of Until Dawn. He appears to have psychosis, which was caused by this depression, and schizophrenia: a mental illness characterized by a disconnection from reality.</p>
        <p class="lb_text"> If the Psychiatric Report is found, it's revealed that Josh has been diagnosed as mentally ill since he was 11 years old. However, all medications that are listed in the record are solely for depression treatment. It is also implied he has a fear of isolation. During Dr. Hill's therapy sessions, the player can choose Josh's anxieties and insecurities. </p>

      <a href="" class="lightbox_close">x</a>
      <article>
        <h3 class="lb_heading"> Ashley "Ash" Brown — The High Priestess </h3>
        <p class="lb_text"> Ashley "Ash" Brown is one of the eight main protagonists and a playable character in Until Dawn. She is portrayed by actress Galadriel Stineman. </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3 class="lb_heading">Personality </h3>
        <p class="lb_text"> Ashley is described in-game as academic, inquisitive, and forthright. According to the companion app, she loves books, dislikes horror movies, and dreams of being an author.</p>
        <p class="lb_text"> Despite her strong feelings about what happened at the Washington Lodge a year ago, Ashley seems to be sweet, friendly, cheerful, and generally eager to be in the company of her friends. Her attendance and actions are partially motivated by her strong feelings toward Chris, whom she has an unexpressed crush on. She is shown to be very observant as, when she finds clues like the Hidden Camera and Faked Newspapers, she's able to recognize their greater significance. However, she does have a tendency to let her imagination run away with her; while Chris is incredulous, Ashley is quick to believe in an apparent ghost she sees and also misunderstands the magnitude of Emily's bite wound. Compared with some of her more loose and laid-back friends, Ashley is rather polite, serious, and even a little hesitant; she doesn't use profanity often like other group members and tends to follow the decisions of others.</p>
        <p class="lb_text"> Her tendency to be meek and timid outlines her lack of self-confidence, and as the night progresses she becomes increasingly distressed and scared by the life-threatening and seemingly supernatural events taking place around her. As such, she at times displays reluctance in looking for Sam when the latter goes missing, though Chris can usually convince her to continue and even show courage in the face of a potential threat. Still, when in actual danger, Ashley is not as quick on her feet as Mike or Emily. This is shown when she manages to stab the Psycho in the shoulder with a pair of scissors, but then fails to either follow up on this attack or escape.</p>
        <p class="lb_text"> Of all the protagonists, Ashley's personality can be shaped and effected the most by the player's choices. While Ashley did partake in the prank against Hannah, she had the least involvement of the participants, being a mere onlooker. Afterwards, she has the most chances express regret about participating in the prank if the player so chooses. However, the player can also choose for her to react dismissively and lay the blame with Hannah, claiming she overreacted. Additionally, depending on the player's actions, Ashley can be shown to possess a vengeful streak. If Chris chose to shoot her and save himself, she'll later refuse to let him into the lodge, leading to him being killed by a Wendigo. However, if Chris is made to do the opposite, Ashley will wait by the door for Chris to return and let him in just in time.</p>

        <p class="lb_text"> Jessica "Jess" Riley is one of the eight main protagonists and a playable character in Until Dawn. She is portrayed by actress Meaghan Martin. </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3 class="lb_heading">Personality </h3>
        <p class="lb_text"> Described in-game as confident, trusting, and irreverent, Jessica is a typical provocative young woman, who is quite brash in personality and dreams of being a model.</p>
        <p class="lb_text"> She is typically laid back, flirty and playful, constantly giving nicknames and acting immature. However, once provoked, she can be quite defensive and fierce. She does seem to care deeply for animals, being shocked and upset after killing a bird and seeing the mauled deer.</p>
        <p class="lb_text"> She is very open about her sexuality, flaunting the fact that she'll have sex with Mike, her boyfriend. Depending on the player's choices, Jessica may reveal to Mike that she uses her seductive skills as a shield from her insecurities.</p>

        <p class="lb_text"> Emily "Em" Davis is one of the eight main protagonists and a playable character in Until Dawn. She is portrayed by actress Nichole Bloom. </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3 class="lb_heading">Personality </h3>
        <p class="lb_text"> Emily is described in-game as intelligent, resourceful, and persuasive. She has a quick tongue and a sharp wit, and is known in the group for her withering put-downs. She mentions that she has a 4.0 GPA during an argument with Jessica.</p>
        <p class="lb_text"> Emily dreams of being a magazine style editor, has a passion for fashion, and dislikes not getting her way in situations. She is quick to temper, and very disagreeable when another's line of thinking is not her own.</p>
        <p class="lb_text"> Emily possesses what can be considered a narcissistic attitude. In a conversation with Matt, she invented two rules she praised Matt for following: "1: Emily is always right. 2: Nothing else matters because Emily is always right." Even in the face of being wrong, Emily's pride forces her to verbally lash out and put another down, Matt being at the forefront of those insults.</p>
        <p class="lb_text"> During the game, it is portrayed that she is "never wrong", and "everything is everyone else's fault." Whenever challenged, Emily has a talent for redirecting conversations and digressing in order to get a one up.</p>
        <p class="lb_text"> Despite her adamant personality, she shows a weaker side when in danger, feeling the need to be protected, and will only protect herself if needed. However, when she is alone she shows courage and independence.</p>
        <p class="lb_text"> Emily shows a deep remorse for the disappearance of Beth and Hannah. In a session with Dr. Hill, he talks about her fear of failure, which he claims Emily has.</p>

        <p class="lb_text"> Michael "Mike" Munroe is one of the eight main protagonists and a playable character in Until Dawn. He is portrayed by actor Brett Dalton.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3 class="lb_heading">Personality </h3>
        <p class="lb_text"> Described in-game as intelligent, driven and persuasive, Mike is known among the survivors for being promiscuous, and "loves women" despite his hatred of commitment.</p>
        <p class="lb_text"> According to a hallucination of Dr. Hill, Mike has a fear of isolation despite being on his own more than any other character in the game. However, this could just be a misrepresentation of Mike from the patient's perspective. It should be noted Mike may have a fear of misfortune towards his friends or them turning against him or each other. This is supported by the fact he fears the idea of Emily becoming a Wendigo, considers Chris unreliable after Chris knocks out Josh, expresses disbelief at the idea of Hannah cannibalizing Beth, and is also shown to exhibit a slight martyr complex, declaring that he will keep his friends safe and will risk himself to go to the Wendigos' lair alone, as well as sacrificing his own life to kill the Wendigos if needed.</p>
        <p class="lb_text"> Mike initially comes across as being self-absorbed, somewhat vain, immature and an all round stereotypical 'jock'. However, over the events of the game he emerges as a brave and resourceful young man, putting his own life at risk to help his friends and trying to ensure the others' survival.</p>

        <br>

        <p class="lb_text">Sam is described in-game as diligent, considerate, and adventurous. She seems to be the most level-headed and friendly member of the group and is rarely the cause of drama, even though she can be spunky and have somewhat of a strong personality.</p>

        <p class="lb_text"> Christopher "Chris" Hartley is one of the eight main protagonists and a playable character in Until Dawn. He is portrayed by actor Noah Fleiss.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3 class="lb_heading">Personality </h3>
        <p class="lb_text">Described as methodical, protective, and humorous, Chris' three highest base traits are charitable, funny and curious. He's very affable and has a witty sense of humor which can be off-putting to his friends. He's analytical, not one to believe in the occult, and isn't easily scared.</p>
        <p class="lb_text">Chris is also a lover of gadgets, and can't go long without looking at his phone screen. He dreams of being an app designer. He loves technology, and can't stand a place without internet access.</p>
        <p class="lb_text">During the events of Until Dawn, it becomes obvious that he is very protective and truly cares for his friends as he insists on finding Sam and risks his life to rescue Josh. Depending on the player's choice, he may also sacrifice himself (though he is later shown to be fine) to save Ashley in one of the Psycho's traps.</p>
        <p class="lb_text">Chris seems to have trouble confessing his real feelings towards his crush Ashley, making him the target for all the teasing by Josh.</p>

        <h3 class="lb_heading"> Matthew "Matt" Taylor — The Hanged Man </h3>
        <p class="lb_text"> Matthew "Matt" Taylor is one of the eight main protagonists and a playable character in Until Dawn. He is portrayed by actor Jordan Fisher.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3 class="lb_heading">Personality </h3>
        <p class="lb_text"> Matt is described in-game as motivated, ambitious and active, which is mostly remarking on his visible passion for sports. Despite his impressively strong appearance, Matt's character is far from being impetuous: he generally comes across as friendly, even being described as the good guy of the group by Dr. Hill. He's not the sharpest tool in the shed, but he has a big heart and knows when to stay out of the way of situations.</p>
        <p class="lb_text">Matt is also described as having low bravery, which is mainly translated to mean that he is a pushover, especially when it comes to his new girlfriend, Emily, to whom he is fiercely loyal to. Their relationship can be clearly quite one-sided at times, and Emily may take advantage of this trait.</p>
        <p class="lb_text">However, his cowardly side can be countered by his brave side, in which he risks his own well-being and safety to save those close to him.</p>
